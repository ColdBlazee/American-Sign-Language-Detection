# American-Sign-Language-Detection

This project was made by me in IBM Call for Code Hackathon 
In this project we a model that will be able to detect different alphabets depicted in American Sign Language using Convolution Neural Networks and OpenCV
Model is accurate in predecting images,but I neend to work on OpenCV
